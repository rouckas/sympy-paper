SymPy has a rich collection of expression printers.
By default, an interactive Python session will render the
\verb|str| form of an expression, which has been used in all the examples in
this paper so far. The \verb|str| form of an expression is valid Python and
roughly matches what a user would type to enter the expression.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> phi0 = Symbol('phi0')
>>> str(Integral(sqrt(phi0), phi0))
'Integral(sqrt(phi0), phi0)'
\end{verbatim}

Expressions can be printed with 2D, monospace fonts via \verb|pprint|. This
uses Unicode characters to render mathematical symbols such as integral signs,
square roots, and parentheses. Greek letters and subscripts in symbol names
that have Unicode code points associated with them
are also rendered automatically.

Alternately, the \verb|use_unicode=False| flag can be set, which causes the
expression to be printed using only ASCII characters.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> pprint(Integral(sqrt(phi0 + 1), phi0), use_unicode=False)
  /
 |
 |   __________
 | \/ phi0 + 1  d(phi0)
 |
/
\end{verbatim}

The function \verb|latex| returns a \LaTeX{} representation of an expression.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print(latex(Integral(sqrt(phi0 + 1), phi0)))
\int \sqrt{\phi_{0} + 1}\, d\phi_{0}
\end{verbatim}

Users are encouraged to run the \verb|init_printing| function at the beginning
of interactive sessions, which automatically enables the best pretty printing
supported by their environment. In the Jupyter Notebook or Qt
Console~\cite{perez2007ipython}, the \LaTeX{} printer is used to render
expressions using MathJax or \LaTeX{}, if it is installed on the system. The
2D text representation is used otherwise.

Other printers such as MathML are also available. SymPy uses an extensible
printer subsystem for customizing the printing for any given
printer, and for custom objects to define their printing behavior for any
printer. The code generation capabilities of SymPy
use this subsystem to convert expressions into code in various target
programming languages.
