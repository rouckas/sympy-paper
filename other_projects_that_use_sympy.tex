There are several projects that use SymPy as a library for implementing
a part of their project, or even as a back-end for their
application:

\subsection{Project Details}\label{projects-details}

Particular examples of SymPy use in some of the projects
listed above are given below:

\subsubsection{SfePy}\label{sfepy}

\href{http://sfepy.org/}{\textbf{SfePy}} (Simple finite elements in Python),
cf.~\cite{cimrman2014sfepy} is a Python package for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) in 1D, 2D and 3D by the finite element (FE)
method~\cite{Zienkiewicz2013FEM}. SymPy is used within this package mostly for
code generation and testing, namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item generation of the hierarchical FE basis module, involving generation and
  symbolic differentiation of 1D Legendre and Lobatto polynomials, constructing
  the FE basis polynomials~\cite{Solin2003hpfem} and generating the C code;
\item generation of symbolic conversion formulas for various groups of elastic
  constants~\cite{Fung1993contmech}:  provide any two of the Young's modulus,
  Poisson's ratio, bulk modulus, Lam\'{e}'s first parameter, shear modulus
  (Lam\'{e}'s second parameter) or longitudinal wave modulus and get the other
  ones;
\item simple physical unit conversions, generation of consistent unit sets;
\item testing FE solutions using method of manufactured (analytical)
  solutions:  the differential operator of a PDE is symbolically applied and a symbolic
  right-hand side is created, evaluated in quadrature points, and subsequently
  used to obtain a numerical solution that is then compared to the analytical
  one;
\item testing accuracy of 1D, 2D and 3D numerical quadrature formulas
  (cf.~\cite{Abramowitz1964handbook}) by generating polynomials of suitable
  orders, integrating them, and comparing the results with those obtained by
  the numerical quadrature.
\end{itemize}
