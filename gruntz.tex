SymPy calculates limits using the Gruntz algorithm, as described in%
~\cite{Gruntz1996limits}. The basic idea is as follows: any limit can be
converted to a limit $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} f(x)$ by substitutions like
$x\to{1\over x}$. Then the subexpression $\omega$ (that converges
to zero as $x\to\infty$ faster than all other subexpressions) is identified in
$f(x)$, and $f(x)$ is expanded into a series with respect to $\omega$. Any
positive powers of $\omega$ converge to zero (while negative powers indicate
an infinite limit) and any constant term independent of
$\omega$ determines the limit. When a constant term still dependends on
$x$ the Gruntz algorithm is applied again until a final numerical value
is obtained as the limit.

To determine the most rapidly varying subexpression, the comparability classes
must first be defined, by calculating $L$:
\begin{equation}
L\equiv \lim_{x\to\infty} {\log |f(x)| \over \log |g(x)|}
\end{equation}
And then operations $<$, $>$ and $\sim$ are defined as follows: $f>g$ when
$L=\pm\infty$ (it is said that $f$ is more rapidly varying than $g$, i.e., $f$
goes to $\infty$ or $0$ faster than $g$, $f$ is greater than any power of $g$),
$f<g$ when $L=0$ ($f$ is less rapidly varying than $g$) and $f\sim g$ when
$L\neq 0,\pm\infty$ (both $f$ and $g$ are bounded from above and below by
suitable integral powers of the other). Here are some examples of comparability
classes:
$$2 < x < e^x < e^{x^2} < e^{e^x}$$
$$2\sim 3\sim -5$$
$$x\sim x^2\sim x^3\sim {1\over x}\sim x^m\sim -x$$
$$e^x\sim e^{-x}\sim e^{2x}\sim e^{x+e^{-x}}$$
$$f(x)\sim{1\over f(x)}$$

The Gruntz algorithm is now illustrated with the following example:
\begin{equation}
    \label{gruntz_example_fn}
f(x) = e^{x+2e^{-x}} - e^x + {1\over x} \,.
\end{equation}
The goal is to calculate $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} f(x)$.
First, the set of most rapidly varying subexpressions is determined, the so
called \textit{mrv set}. For~\eqref{gruntz_example_fn}, the following mrv set
$\{e^x, e^{-x}, e^{x+2e^{-x}}\}$ is obtained. These are all subexpressions of%
~\eqref{gruntz_example_fn} and they all belong to the same comparability class.
This calculation can be done using SymPy as follows:

% dict_keys output order varies
% no-doctest
\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy.series.gruntz import mrv
>>> mrv(exp(x+2*exp(-x))-exp(x) + 1/x, x)[0].keys()
dict_keys([exp(x + 2*exp(-x)), exp(x), exp(-x)])
\end{verbatim}

Next, an arbitrary item $\omega$ is taken from mrv that converges to zero for
$x\to\infty$. The item $\omega=e^{-x}$ is obtained. If such a term is not
present in the mrv set (i.e., all terms converge to infinity instead of zero),
the relation $f(x)\sim {1\over f(x)}$ can be used.

The next step is to rewrite the mrv in terms of $\omega$: $\{{1\over\omega},
\omega, {1\over\omega}e^{2\omega}\}$. Then the original subexpressions are
substituted back into $f(x)$ and expanded with respect to $\omega$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{gruntz_example_fn2}
f(x) = {1\over x}-{1\over\omega}+{1\over\omega}e^{2\omega}
     = 2+{1\over x} + 2\omega + O(\omega^2)
\end{equation}

Since $\omega$ is from the mrv set, then in the limit $x\to\infty$ it is
$\omega\to0$ and so $2\omega + O(\omega^2) \to 0$ in~\eqref{gruntz_example_fn2}:
\begin{equation}
f(x) = {1\over x}-{1\over\omega}+{1\over\omega}e^{2\omega}
    = 2+{1\over x} + 2\omega + O(\omega^2)
    \to 2 + {1\over x}
\end{equation}

Since the result ($2+{1\over x}$) still depends on $x$, the above procedure is
repeated until just a value independent of $x$ is obtained. This is the final
limit. In the above case the limit is $2$, as can be
verified by SymPy:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> limit(exp(x+2*exp(-x))-exp(x) + 1/x, x, oo)
2
\end{verbatim}

In general, when $f(x)$ is expanded in terms of $\omega$, it is obtained:
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \underbrace{O\left({1\over \omega^3}\right)}_\infty
    + \underbrace{C_{-2}(x)\over \omega^2}_\infty
    + \underbrace{C_{-1}(x)\over \omega}_\infty
    + {C_{0}(x)}
    + \underbrace{C_{1}(x)\omega}_0
    + \underbrace{O(\omega^2)}_0
\end{equation}
The positive powers of $\omega$ are zero. If there are any negative powers of
$\omega$, then the result of the limit is infinity, otherwise the limit is
equal to $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} C_0(x)$. The expression $C_0(x)$ is simpler
than $f(x)$ and so the algorithm always converges. A proof of this, as well as
further details are given in Gruntz's PhD thesis~\cite{Gruntz1996limits}.
